I had moved the jumpers on the back of the display to "8080 Parallel" for a propeller project. Once I put them back on "4 wire SPI" it works great.

Frustrating. I tried to hook the display up again but I don't get anything. I'm using the Pi2 this time. I guess I can try the old Pi. And maybe break out the scope. Sigh. I wanted this part to just work.
